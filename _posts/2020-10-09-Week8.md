### YOUR CHECKLIST FOR SESSION ON 09th OCT @ 13:30 PM IST


> Items ticked are highly recomended to be completed before session, unticked ones are for the more adventerous of you :)


- [x] Day1: Go through the KNN slide deck and practice [this notebook](https://github.com/bharathkreddy/knn-classifier/blob/main/Knn%20-%20wisconsin%20breast%20cancer%20data.ipynb).  
- [x] Day2: Recreate [this notebook](https://github.com/bharathkreddy/knn-classifier/blob/main/KNN%20pima%20india%20dataset.ipynb) and [this notebook](https://github.com/bharathkreddy/knn-classifier/blob/main/Radial%20NN%20Iris%20dataset.ipynb)
- [x] Day3: Go through the KNN slide deck and practice [this notebook]() and [this notebook]()
- [x] Day4: Run Logisitic Regression, KNN and Naive Bayes algorithms on Titanic and Pima India diabetes dataset. Compare the accuracy reports, Let's have a discussion next week on your observations. 
- [X] Day5: I have saved over hundred datasets [here](https://github.com/bharathkreddy/ML-Bootcamp/tree/master/data), try picking a few datasets and see if you can try everything that you have learnt so far on these - missing values , categorical values and then model.
