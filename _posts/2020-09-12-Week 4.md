> If you are not able to understand a particular command or function in any of the notebooks i have asked you to refer - use these resources, google, stackoverflow. 99 of 100 times you would find your answer. If you still cant - drop me an email or whatsapp me.


> Also keep the [ebook](https://github.com/bharathkreddy/ML-Bootcamp/blob/master/000%20Python_for_Data_Analysis__Data_Wran(z-lib.org).pdf) handy and refer to this as often as you can to clear your doubts on any of the commands.


> Next week onwards we are going to move to machine learning and you would need to be very clear with everything i have covered so far. This is very important for you to be able to understand any of future sessions.
